I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science working with Dr. Ming Lin at UMD. My research interests include learning-based autonomous driving, computer vision, and most recently HCI. Most recently, I have been working on projects related to traffic-aware autonomous driving for societal benefit, as well as quantifying complex human driving behavior through VR. 

I am actively looking for research internship opportunities for Summer 2023.
