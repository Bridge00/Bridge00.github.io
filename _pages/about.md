I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science working with [Professor Ming Lin](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/) at UMD. My research interests include learning-based autonomous driving, computer vision, and most recently HCI. Most recently, I have been working on projects related to traffic-aware autonomous driving for societal benefit, as well as quantifying complex human driving behavior through VR. 
Outside of research, I like playing ice hockey, listening to orchestral music, and playing/watching e-sports. 

I am actively looking for research internship opportunities for Summer 2023. In terms of internships, I am particularly interested about multi-agent problems in robotics as well as HCI / learning applications for autonomous driving.
